    <p class="roboto paragraph">This paragraph is about me . Here I will tell u everything you need to know about my journey. I started all of this coding work when a sudden boom of coding came to india with whitehat.jr and I researched everything on my own then got to know about certain things.From there I decided to take a typing course so that my typing speed can be something around 40-60 WPM and I can code easily . I also did join a cricket academy in the starting due to the craze of cricket here in India and I think I made the right choice . I made many friends there built some mental as well as physical strength. For as of now I play ukulele I do chess and much more . I am currently in class 10 a 16 year old dreaming to be a engineer all day along</p>
