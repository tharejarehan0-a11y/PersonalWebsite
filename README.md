This is My First Repositry that i commited and my personal website that was given as task from hack club This is not responsive to phones and only works on computers and tablets

To build it
1. you need to set up the basic html structure
2. create some divs and then add basic p ans span tag and give classes and id's to them
3. then create css files and as many as pages you want and attach to the main file a
4. then style as you wish

will later be made responsive for phones also
