        <p class="paragraph roboto">Being a mechatronics Engineer fascinates me. I am truly inspired by the fact that I can create something that is moveable can react to things something that can understand me and the fun part that i built it all from scratch. Mechatronics is a field i think has the most potential because it is the combination computer science electronics and mechanical engineering and you get to study basically everything that a robot needs</p>
